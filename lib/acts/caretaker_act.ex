defmodule Bonfire.Me.Acts.Caretaker do
  @moduledoc """
  An act that deals with maintaining a `Caretaker` record for a changeset.

  During insertion, adds an associated insert if a caretaker can be found in the epic options.

  During deletion, ensures that the related record will be cleaned up.

  Epic Options (insert):
    * `:caretaker` - user that will take care of the post, falls back to `:current_user`
    * `:current_user` - user that will taker care of the post, fallback if `:caretaker` is not set.

  Act Options:
    * `:on` - key to find changeset, required.
